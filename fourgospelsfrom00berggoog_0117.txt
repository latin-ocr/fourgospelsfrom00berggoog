late sixti· or early seventh century. The work os the corrector it sometimes a clue ιο the reading
of the first nand: viz.¹ the discovery os adulescentes in the large letters of 11¹³ above the line in
1 St. Peter v. 5 led to the search for :nd discovery of the reading undernnth—-el noe ηιύιονιπ natu.

The Frngments eontain twenty-three lines on a page,¹ and are headed xrisma nrm rxnu
(uel suenum), and umor-A remmus rumn- The titles ore in uncials which ure only slightly
lai-ger than the average size of those used in the text. The sine of individua! lenem varies
considenbly in different lines in the MS. Sometimes the scribe couti-acts and sometimes be
expands the size and interspaees os his letters. On the snrne page he will write fisty letters in one
line and but forty in a subsequent line, his usual number being about sorny—eight, os which sorty
on an average now survive. Α remarkable unfixedness in the spelling of proper names it notice·
able in the Acts, where Paulus is variously spelt paulus, laular, paus, find even populus-3 whilst
Mores appears ns merses, moni-es nnd mosset. Α similar unfixedness of spelling occurs inff. The
form arir'm, which regularly replaees enim in the Epistles of St. Peter, is a pecudiarity of la that
also deserves attention. Os the punctuation that 1 hzve discovered not more tlun five (or six)
points, if we except numenh, can be ascribed to 11⁸: the rest is due to Ιι· aud hb.

Arm revising the Cutholic Epistles I set myself to decipher the few lines in tbe Apoealypse
und Acm which dut eminent scholar the late Samuel Berger had not fully deciphered. Berger
εεειίῐῃρϋέιὶἑῖἱ mutire Ιὴῦῃιυιζ ‘inde‘ ῗιὶιε ωςὲιεεωῶἓιὴῇιζεάᾀοιιε 3 but he himselfddid not regard his
wor as . ypersis en su y ave na e iscover some new rea mgs.

Many pages in the MS. must be read upside down in respect of the superpoeed writing.¹ In
the sew instantes where 1 differ from Berger it is only aster a {brice-repeated examination both of
the MS⁴ and ol photographs that 1 secured in Paris of the more difficult μεμε. 1 wa happy
enough in the end to decipher every word undeciphered by Berger. ln Actu xiv. ⁶ the imer-
polaiion sicul ins dr'xenu eis LX[XII] is, 1 believe, peculiar- to ΛΜ*- lt is doubly interesting
beoeuse St. Luke ie the only one who mentions the LXX LXXII] in his Goepel. It is almost
certain, from consideratione os space, that our MS. read XXII and not Lxx. The use of
fidelilar: πὺπις (iii. 16) find languidus = ἀδύνατος (xiv. 7) is also noxewonhy. The wordss of
St- Paul in xiv. 9, ti'bn'dt'ta in nomine mu nostri dr'u' filn'de'i,are zlsoread in this form only by Ιι,
though both d and ι have ι somewhat similar text, bin omitfilr' dei.

The heading of the Acts is: news *ros-romum sau-rotun (nie). Similzrly santorum ooonn
sor mulorum in iii. Η. The Apocalypse hae the title: Amuvrsrs romnus nostor-¹.

There is a striking resemblance in ibe Acts between these fragments and the Latin Irenaeum

The correctore who corrected the Catholic Epistles corrected also the Aen md the
Apocalypse, lib constmtly correcta to the nonu ol· the Vulgare. ln Acts iii, ¹3 a new corrector
(11⁰), later than hb, added high above the line ιιι s to tradidr‘sti.

The copyist of the De Munda clipped away as a rule three inchea from one side of euch leaf
before using it.¹ Had he clipped equally from both sides, but few (if any) letters would hnve
perished. As it is, the evei-age loss (rom euch line is about eight leuel-s. ln addition the lines
found at the foex of a few of the pages, as in the case of Folios 120 and ιη, have lost some
additional letters owing to the vellum having become slightly worn on the right-hand margin.
Missing letters have in every mse been restored in bruchem* Inasmuch aa the vellum is normxlly
ahorn vernicully, it is possible m make this restoration with great precision at the beginning of
a line‚¹ by calculating from the space of known missing lenem the space that must have been
