viii INIPODUCTION

Summary.
Evidence for asigningff ω as early a date as 375-4 25 may be discovered in

(a) The unfixedness of the spelling ιο 2 degree unpnraueled in any other MS. Os this
almost every page ol the MS. surnishes proof.

(fl) The exeeeding rarity ol puncmauion.

(γ) The nhsence oi all observance ol' the mles os grammar-3 and the persistente ol
vulgerisms in both grammar nnd spelling.

(ll) The shape md form of the letters, especially of Ε, T, M and O.

(ι) The luge amount of verbal vnriation from the Vulgate, especially in ench well-known
und osten quoted verses as St Matt. xi 28, St. Luke ii. η, St. Mark xiv. ²⁴-

(ζ) The comparative freedom οἵ] from the humonizings which ere found in other texts.
The enrliest texis would be the least harmonized. [Cf. summ xxiv· 35, xxvii 342 Sl. Luke
iii. Η, vi. ³¹ ; St, Mflrk iv. ³9· xiv. ¹⁴⁴]

(θ) The agreement of ff with the Old syriae Vei-siem and with Irenaeum md Origen in
ancient rendings lost in all other MSS.

The cumulative force oi the evidence from these sources cannot be negatived hy impuiing
to ff ¹ the text-121 timidity of the ΕΜ] century '. That the text οῖ’] keeps on the whole neni-er
to the Text. Recept. than do the uther ancient Old Latin MSS. (with the exception os a) ir
a fact which must be recognized, hut it determines nothing either for or against the mtiquity οἵ
our MS. or of its text. In this cnse, as in others, theon-ies must be subserviated to nscemined
facte. The large mensure or support given by the two oldest latin MSS. a and ff to the Text.
Recept. is e fect which can no longer be neglected, especially when it is remembered that ¹ the
text has been preserved with less alteration in the versione than in the MSS!

The render is referred lor a full discussion of this evidence to the writer's articles in the
Journal eff Theolagr'cal Studies l'or October, 1905, end Janunw, ¹90⁶.

The text that follows is ιιι exact print, line ior line und column sor column, of the whole
MS. Where italie type occurs, it nlways, except in the heedings os the peges, denote! rubricated
letters in the on'glmss. All corrections in the MS. earlier than the lweylh century have been faith-
fully given either in the text or in the Appendix at the end oi the volume. The copious later
Vulgate corrections have (for the most part) been omitted.

Porlstrtpt. My wnrmeet thanks are due to the Rev. H. J. White, who, nmong other
services, hu revised the printed sheets os ff with ihe MS. itseliy and han thus conferred on
the present edition a high degree of accumy.

1 have also to thnnk my learned friends, Mr. Α. Soutcr and the Rev. J. F. &mune-Baka,
and my obligations to Professor Bnrkitt, os Cambridge, and Dr. Sanday. os oxford, are ton
many to be here set out in detail. From M. Henri Omont and the other authorities at the
Bibliotheque Nntiounle in Paris 1 lmve received nothing but courtesy during the past eight
years in which 1 heve been ι frequent visitor at their magnificent Library ns MSS.
