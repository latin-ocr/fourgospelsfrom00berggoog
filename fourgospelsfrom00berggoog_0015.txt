consisting of live separate leaves, but which may have once been a ternion. The quires of the
MS. were as follows: i-iii (lost), iv-xiii, xiv (1 md 8 lost), ›tv-xviii, xix (4, 5, and 7 lost), xit-xxviii.

About two centur-ies ago (so it appears) the extant leaves were nurnbered throughout, but
carelessly enough, inasmuch as tveo consecutive leaves are both numbered ⁵5 and two other
consecutive leaves are marked 88. The last leaf ir nurnbered 190, and the Codex therefore,
in its present form, contains neither roo nor ¹9¹· as has been previously stated, but ¹⁹² leave&

Twenty-three signatores are found at the foot of the inner margin os the verso side of
leaves numbered 8, 16, 14, 32, 4ο, 48, ⁵⁵ bis, ⁶3, 71, 79, ⁹²1 roo, 108, 116, nr, ¹²9· ¹3⁷,
145, 153, ιω, 169, 177, and ¹⁸⁵- The leaf that followed 85 and was signed xiiii ia loSt.

In addition to the mode of numben'ng by quaternium signed nt the {ont of the page there
survives a trace os another rnethod of counting by binions. On sol. 48 verso under the title ix

originally on the sevemy-seoond lea-f of the MS„ and 4 x 18 = ⁷²-

'l‘he vellum is aceedingly fine¹ so much so that when photogmphed the letters on the other
side appear through the vellum. Looking nt a photo os sol. 48 verso one might easily read adapil
in St. John iii. ³² for adcipi! owing to part of the letter m os homo being visible through the vellum.

Some pagea os the MS.-notably sol. 49 verno-are as clear to-day aa when they lest tho
hand os the copyist fifteen centurie! ag0; but others are saded and only fully decipherable
by observant study of the MS. ns a whole.

There are two columns or twenty-four lines on ench page. Every page before being
written on has been accumely ruled with twenty-four horizontal lines and four vertical lines.
To guide the horizonta-l ruling a vertiml line os twenty>sour prickings was first made, extending
down the page and about three inches from the right-hand edge os the vellum.
