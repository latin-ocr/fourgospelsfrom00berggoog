INTRODUCTION

THE CODEX CORBEIENSIS

A nnn description of the Codex, together with nn imperfect collation (in St. John, St. Luke,
and St. Mark only), iu given hy Bisnchini in his Evangelianiam Quadrmex, which appeared
in 1749. The select readings given by Bianchini are, however, far from accurate.

Sahuxier niso gave int-iant readings (rather less ncenrately than Binnchini) in the third
volume us his great work behtrrum Sacr. Lakhm Venimus Antiquae seu Velm· Italica, cont-
pleted in ¹74⁸} How inmeante the quotations of Bianehini nnd Sabntier are may be guthered
from the fact that Tischendori's citatione in his Ed. viii maior, which πθ uken from their
work, eontain in St. John's Gospel zlone not fewer than ¹53 false readings.

ln more recent times the Norwegian scholar Belsheitn has pnblished an edition of the
text (without the Capiti-ln or the Prologne to St. Lnke), Christiania, 1887. In Belsheim's work
there is no nttempt to render the Codex line sor line and page for page. The editor tells us
that he noted in a copy of the Vulgate the variant readings he saw in the MS„ and printed his
edition from this mnotated copy⁴ The result has been to give the coda the uppem-enee of
hiving n Vulgnte base in many passages where uo such Vnigate base exista.

Finally, ihe learned English editors os the Vulgate give ι very sun collation ot' the MSS. in
St· Luke and Str John, (In St. Matthew and St. Mark they seem to rely 801er on Tischendorf's
eitations, which nre not nlwayss accurate.) This couzuon is the outcome of the critical mgaeity
os the iate Samuel Berger, whose work in deciphering old Latin MSS. (notably Le Palimprtsle
dt Fleuty) entities him to the gratitude os 211 studenus oi the Latin text os the New Testament-

The early history o( the MS. is involved in utter obscurity. The copyist left no record
os his name or environmenh His work shows him unacquninted with the Latin lmgunge.

The MS. belonged meiently to the Benedictine Monastery οἱ Corbey neat Amiens-once
the home οἱ many precious recorda of the early Christian ages ¹. It entered in mmpmtively
recent limen into the Bibliothbque Royale, whose red stamp it bears on its last page. lt has now
round a home in the Bibliotheqne Nationaie, where it in numbered Lat. ¹⁷.=²⁵-

The Codex has lost three ont of eight quim in St. Mntthew. The first three quires have
perished down to xi. ιθ (not xi. ⁶ ns Belsheim says). The first leaves of ancient MSS. seem most
exposed tn insa: e has lost its first five quires. Two leave· atre missing from St. John containing
xvii. 15-xviii. 9 and xx. 23-xxi. Β reepeetively. Three leaves nse wanting in St Luke ; two oi
these were consecutive and conmined ix, ⁴5-¹· 2o; the third contained xi. 45—xii. 6. anpily
St. Mark is complete except that three leaves—the inst two and the third of Qnire xxvi—are
mutilated. The first two exunt lezves of St. Matthew m niso slightly mutilated ¹.

The Codex originally oonsisted os twenty-seven gatherings os eight, znd ι gethei-ing now
