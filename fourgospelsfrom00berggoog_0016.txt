With reference to the capitula, found in our MS„ but wanting in most oid Latin MSS„
there is good ren-son to believe that they did not sonu part os the archetype from which the text
of ff was copied, but were gnthered from another MS, which had affinities with the pzrent of the
DEPGQ aar r grmp, whose Capitula are given by Wordsworssi and White in their edition os the
Vulgare Gospels ¹.

As regards the paragr-ephe in ff, they exhibit a cnriuue currespondence with mose in e. It
may be roughiy stated that five out of every six breaks in the nmative in ι are also found in ff.
The paragnphs in b and ff in St. John are almost identical.

The result os the comparison of the pusaeognphy offfwith that os other ancient Latin MSS.
has convii-ced the present writer that ff must rank with a iu point os nntiquity. 1t ie earlier than
hut· or n, 2nd niso earlier than b. Many os the letters in ff resemble the uncia] letters current in
the fourth century. The M in ff ie a replica of the M οἱ the fourth century Cicero Palimpsest nt
Rome, PaL Su. ii. Pl. 1⁶0.

One cannot tabulate all the palaeographieal impressimus that mre rtoeived {rom s MS* and
tint lead to the belief that it ie earlier or later thui another. The great simplicity usthe letters inff,
the absence as nn knobs or ornamenta] points, the mallum und plainam· os the capiate, the
stmightness and thinness of lines making abbreviations, the extreme ranty os punctuation -ιΙΙ
these eontnbute to the conviction that ff betongs ιο a remote snuquity, and that it surpasses in
age 211 other Old Latin MSS. with the exception os a,

Character ff Ibe Codex.

The study os a MS* involves a twofold menni process—the ascertaining os the chaneter
os the scribe's exemplar und az the same time the nseertaining os the character of the scribe
him-etr.

The licence of Western scribes is elmost proverbial, and has been md by Hort as ι strong
argui-nent sor dismiseing as summarily as he hus done the evidence os Western MSS. When
a MS. such as e writes, sor exampley capharnaum sor nam, and capharnaum uiso for corozain,
conrounds Cleophas and Cephas and alters the context accordingly, the student may well hesitate
about neeepting any singular readings os sud: ε codex. Δ witness who distorte even n few sacis
impeirs the value os his evidence as ει whole.

The striking character of ff is the absence os any meh errore as those just named. There
are unconseious errore of trunscription such ss are found in nli MSS. ; but os wilrul alteration os
the text from ¹ supposed fitne„ sor immediate and obvious edifioetion ' there is, rothe best of the
present writers belief, not a single instance,

The singular readings offfare quite different iu character from most of the singular readings
os e, nr even of b or k.

Another source os obliteratinn ot ancient readings is the Harmonistic proclivity os msny
scribes—the result ⁰1 such compilatione, as Ephrem's Diatmam. Again, ff ean be shown tn
be more free from this influence than any extant Latin or Greek MS.
